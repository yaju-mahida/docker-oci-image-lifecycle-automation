**Monitor. Review. Release. Publish. Govern.**

Detect upstream container-image drift, create reviewed Dockerfile updates,
and release trusted OCI images with GitHub Actions. Docker Image Lifecycle
Automation uses immutable manifest digests to detect tag moves and same-tag
rebuilds, then provides a governed path through build, test, scan, SBOM,
provenance, signing, release, and multi-registry distribution.

> **Most tools detect a changed tag. This platform detects a changed image.**

## Start at the right level

Choose the smallest adoption path that solves your problem:

| Goal | Start here | Time to first result |
|---|---|---:|
| Resolve and pin an OCI image digest | [Digest monitor example](examples/digest-monitor.yml) | 1 minute |
| Detect base-image drift and open a reviewable PR | [Minimal monitor template](templates/minimal-monitor.yml) | 5 minutes |
| Build, verify, sign, release, and publish images | [Secure lifecycle template](templates/secure-release.yml) | 10 minutes |
| Apply environment gates and organization policy | [Enterprise lifecycle template](templates/enterprise-release.yml) | 15 minutes |

The root Marketplace Action resolves any OCI image tag to its immutable
manifest digest:

```yaml
- id: upstream
  uses: yaju-mahida/docker-oci-image-lifecycle-automation@v1
  with:
    registry: docker.io
    repository: library/nginx
    tag: stable

- run: echo "${{ steps.upstream.outputs.digest }}"
```

For the complete lifecycle, copy a template into the adopting repository.
The templates call the reusable monitoring and release workflows while the
adopting repository retains its own schedule, approvals, credentials, and
release policy.

## Why Docker OCI Image Lifecycle Automation

| Lifecycle problem | Platform capability |
|---|---|
| An upstream publisher rebuilds an unchanged tag | Digest-first detection catches the content change |
| Teams need control before a Dockerfile changes | Evidence-backed, reviewable update PRs |
| Release pipelines vary by repository | Reusable lifecycle contracts with repository-owned policy |
| Publishing an image is not sufficient evidence | Trivy, SPDX SBOMs, BuildKit provenance, and optional Cosign signing |
| Multiple OCI registries increase operational complexity | One registry abstraction for public, private, cloud, and generic OCI registries |

## Architecture

                    ▼
Reusable lifecycle workflows
  Monitor → update PR → build → test → scan → publish → sign → release

Composite lifecycle actions

Read the [architecture guide](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for contracts,
responsibilities, and compatibility guarantees.

## Quick start

1. Copy [`templates/minimal-monitor.yml`](templates/minimal-monitor.yml) to
   `.github/workflows/image-lifecycle.yml` in the image repository.
2. Confirm the `uses:` reference points at
   `yaju-mahida/docker-oci-image-lifecycle-automation@v1`, or change the owner
   if you are consuming an approved fork.
3. Set `DOCKERFILE_PATH`, `BASE_IMAGE_UPDATE_POLICY`, and optional reviewer
   variables.
4. Run the workflow manually in dry-run mode, then enable its schedule.
5. Move to [`templates/secure-release.yml`](templates/secure-release.yml)
   when you are ready to publish signed, verified images.

## Supported integration models

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Resolve an OCI tag to a digest | Root Marketplace Action (`yaju-mahida/docker-oci-image-lifecycle-automation@v1`) |
| Monitor an upstream image and create update PRs | `reusable-base-image-monitor.yml` |
| Build, verify, release, and publish an image | `reusable-docker-release.yml` |
| Adopt a lifecycle in stages | `templates/minimal-monitor.yml`, `templates/secure-release.yml`, or `templates/enterprise-release.yml` |
| Configure multiple/custom registries | `templates/docker-automation.yml` |

## Secure by default

Use immutable image digests or immutable release identifiers for deployment.
Mutable aliases such as `latest`, `stable`, and upstream tags are opt-in
convenience labels, never secure deployment inputs. Set `SIGN_IMAGES=true`
to keylessly sign every published image digest using Cosign and GitHub OIDC.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for reporting and responsibility guidance.
